scenario: Initial Reset Verification
description: Assert asynchronous reset (areset=1) and verify output goes to OFF state (out=0) immediately regardless of other inputs

scenario: OFF to ON Transition
description: From OFF state, assert j=1 and verify transition to ON state (out=1) on next clock edge while k input varies

scenario: ON to OFF Transition
description: From ON state, assert k=1 and verify transition to OFF state (out=0) on next clock edge while j input varies

scenario: State Retention OFF
description: In OFF state with j=0, verify state remains OFF (out=0) across multiple clock cycles regardless of k input

scenario: State Retention ON
description: In ON state with k=0, verify state remains ON (out=1) across multiple clock cycles regardless of j input

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while in ON state and verify immediate transition to OFF state regardless of j/k inputs

scenario: Input Toggle Stress
description: Rapidly toggle j and k inputs to verify correct state transitions under dynamic input conditions

scenario: Invalid Input Handling
description: Apply undefined (X) or high-impedance (Z) values to j/k inputs and verify stable state machine operation
